    <p>5 ingredeint, 5 minute prep time peanut buttery goodness!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened plain almond milk</il>
      <li>3/4 Tbspp chia seeds</il>
      <li>2 Tbsdp natural salted peanut butter</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add almond milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, and maple syrup (or other sweetener) and stir with a spoon to combine. The peanut butter doesn’t need to be completely mixed with the almond milk (doing so leaves swirls of peanut butter to enjoy the next day).</li>
      <li>Add oats and stir a few more times. Then <strong>press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk.</strong></li>
      <li>Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak.</li>
      <li>The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings (see options above). See more flavor/topping suggestions in the blog post above! <p><strong>OPTIONAL: You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there’s enough room at the top of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry.</strong></p></li>
      <li>Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours in our experience. Not freezer friendly.</li>
